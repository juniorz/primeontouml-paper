# A Domain Specific Language for OntoUML

## Abstract

> This work provides both a textual syntax to creating conceptual models 
> based on a philosophically and cognitively well-founded modeling language,
> named OntoUML, and an editor to the language itself.
>
> First, we review the integrity constraints contained in the language's metamodel
> and we suit them to be compatible with the current tooling.
>
> Then, we propose a textual concrete syntax (a domain specific language, DSL)
> to represent the concepts existing in the metamodel.
>
> In the sequel, we design a textual editor based on the Eclipse platform
> to allow users to create and manipulate OntoUML models using the proposed DSL.
>
> The goal is to create a textual language that represents the concepts of
> the OntoUML language and provide a tool needed for its use.
>
> Therefore, in this work we propose a concrete syntax to the OntoUML language
> and provide a tool which support the editing, syntax validation and
> transformation of models.
